# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-05-07)

**Core value:** Every LeetCode problem you solve becomes a first-class note in your Obsidian vault — tagged, linked, and discoverable — so practice builds a knowledge graph instead of scattered code files.
**Current focus:** Phase 05 — polish-ship

## Current Position

Phase: 05 (polish-ship) — EXECUTING
Plan: 1 of 7
Status: Executing Phase 05
Last activity: 2026-05-10 -- Phase 05 execution started

Progress: [█░░░░░░░░░░] partial 04-01

### Pause reason

LeetCode migrated submission detail from server-rendered HTML (`var pageData` scrape)
to a Next.js SPA backed by GraphQL `submissionDetails($submissionId: Int!)`. RESEARCH
§A3 flagged this as MEDIUM-risk; it has materialized. Waves 1–5 cannot execute against
the planned wire shape. See `.planning/phases/04-knowledge-graph-wiring/04-01-SUMMARY.md`
for the full finding + remediation path.

### Resume path

1. `/gsd-discuss-phase 4` OR `/gsd-plan-phase 4 --gaps` — update RESEARCH §Pattern B
   and 04-CONTEXT.md D-27/D-28/D-29 against the GraphQL shape.

2. Regenerate the 04-01 `submissionHistoryClient.test.ts detail` subtest to reflect GraphQL.
3. Rewrite 04-03 tasks to POST /graphql/ instead of scrape HTML.
4. Re-enter `/gsd-execute-phase 4` — Task 3 (grep gate, one-liner) can ship standalone first.

## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Phase 1: `requestUrl` adapter must be the first thing wired — nothing calls LC until `fetcher.set()` is bridged; native `fetch`/`axios` are CORS-blocked in Electron renderer
- Phase 1: `isDesktopOnly: true` in `manifest.json` is mandatory before first commit — auto-rejected by store bot if absent
- Phase 1: All Electron imports (`require('electron').BrowserWindow`) confined to `auth/BrowserWindowLogin.ts` only — cookie-paste fallback must be first-class, not an afterthought
- Phase 2: Frontmatter schema (`lc-` prefix), filename scheme (`{id}-{slug}.md`), and tag namespace (`lc/`) locked in `NoteTemplate.ts` — never changed without a migration tool
- Phase 3: Highest-risk phase; capture live fixtures for all six verdict types (AC/WA/TLE/MLE/CE/RE) before implementing polling logic
- Phase 4: All vault writes via `vault.process()` + `processFrontMatter()` only — `vault.modify()` on problem notes is permanently forbidden

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 3 has a research/spike dependency: LC REST endpoint response shapes for all verdict types must be captured against the live service before implementation. This is the highest-risk phase.
- BrowserWindow cookie extraction must be tested manually on macOS, Windows, and Linux during Phase 1 — timing and partition issues are platform-specific.
